# Why Compassion as Measurement, not Adaptive Measurement
为什么是“慈悲的测量”，而不是“自适应测量”

---

## Core distinction｜核心区分

In this framework, *measurement* is an intervention that reshapes the
possibility space.

The key question is not whether the intervention improves performance,
but what orientation guides the intervention itself.

在本框架中，测量是一种会重塑可能性空间的判断介入行为。
关键问题不是：
判断是否更有效，
而是：
判断是由何种取向所引导。

## Why not adaptive measurement

Adaptive measurement describes a system’s capacity to adjust to its
environment.

Its implicit normative reference is usually:

- survival
- efficiency
- performance
- stability of the system itself

“自适应测量”关注的是系统如何更好地应对环境变化，
其隐含目标往往是系统自身的存活、效率或稳定性。

Adaptive measurement therefore answers the question:

How can the system adapt better?

## What compassion adds

Compassion, in this framework, is not an emotion and not a moral label.

It is an orientation of judgment that deliberately brings
the situations of others and the systemic consequences of decisions
into the structure of selection.

在本框架中，慈悲不是情绪，也不是道德评价，
而是一种判断取向：

在介入可能性空间时，
主动将他者处境与系统性后果纳入判断结构。

Compassion therefore changes the reference of intervention.

It asks:

Who and what are allowed to reshape the possibility space?

---

## Structural difference

Adaptive measurement evaluates whether a system adapts successfully.

Compassion as measurement examines how an intervention restructures
the boundaries of who and what can still be chosen.

自适应测量关注的是系统是否适应得更好。

慈悲的测量关注的是：
一次判断如何改变了
谁仍然被纳入选择，
谁被排除在未来之外。

---

## Why compassion cannot be replaced by adaptation

Many measurement actions in this framework
— such as opening measurement and deferred measurement —
may reduce short-term efficiency or slow down response.

From an adaptive perspective, such interventions may appear suboptimal.

However, they remain necessary when the aim is to prevent
the premature collapse of the possibility space
and the silent exclusion of affected others.

因此，本框架并不以“适应性表现”作为唯一正当性来源。

---

## Core statement

Adaptive measurement concerns the capability of a system to respond.

Compassion as measurement concerns the responsibility for how judgment
reshapes the space of possible futures.

自适应描述能力，
慈悲描述介入方向。

---

## One-line summary

This framework is not designed to help systems adapt better,
but to take responsibility for how judgments restructure
who and what can still be chosen.
