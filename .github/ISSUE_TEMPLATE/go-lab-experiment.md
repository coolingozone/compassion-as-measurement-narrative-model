# Go-Lab Experiment Record

---

## 1. Problem identification
Describe the situation or problem instance.

Include reference (image, link, or description).

---

## 2. Possibility space identification
List all plausible actions or moves available at this stage.

Example:
- Move A
- Move B
- Move C

---

## 3. External forces identification (if any)

External forces change what is structurally possible.

Examples:
- Rule constraints
- Time constraints
- Resource limits
- Environmental constraints

External forces identified:
- 

---

## 4. Noise identification

Noise affects perception and judgment but does not change structural reality.

Examples:
- Urgency
- Fear of loss
- Emotional impulse
- Habitual reaction

Noise observed:
-

## 5. Measurement configuration selected

Timing:
- [ ] Immediate measurement
- [ ] Deferred measurement

Type:
- [ ] Exclusion measurement
- [ ] Opening measurement
- [ ] Restructuring measurement

Explain why this configuration was selected:

---

## 6. Measurement intervention applied

Describe what was done to perform measurement.

Examples:
- Re-evaluated structure
- Explored alternative topology
- Removed false assumptions

---

## 7. Structural change observed

Describe how perception of the possibility space changed.

Examples:
- New critical point identified
- Previously assumed escape no longer viable
- Hidden structural weakness revealed

---

## 8. Final action selected

State the actual action chosen after measurement.

Example:
Final move selected: D2

---

## 9. Framework executability

Was the framework executable?

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

Explain briefly:

---

## 10. Reflection

What was learned from this experiment?

Examples:
- Measurement changed perceived topology
- Initial impulse was noise-driven
- Structural intervention clarified optimal action
